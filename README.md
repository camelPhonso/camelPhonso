<h3 align="left">Background</h3>
<p align="left">
My previous experience includes 4 years as a HR professional and a few years prior to that as an operational manager across different kinds of businesses. These roles had a strong focus on the soft skills needed for cooperation and also a lot of real-world problem solving and a creative approach to building scalable working systems.

As a HR professional I also did a lot of work focused on setting up and improving Information Systems, which triggered my curiosity over a change of career.
