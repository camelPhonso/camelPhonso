<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Alphonso</h1>
<h2 align="center">Front-end Web Developer</h2>

- 🌱 I’m currently learning **through Founders and Coders skills bootcamp**

- 👨‍💻 All of my projects are available [right here!](https://github.com/camelPhonso?tab=repositories)

<h2 align="left">Background</h2>
<p align="left">
My previous experience includes 4 years as a HR professional and some years prior to that as an operational manager across different kinds of businesses. These roles had a strong focus on the soft skills needed for cooperation and team-building as well as a lot of real-world problem solving and a creative approach to building scalable working systems.

Working in a tech start-up environment I gained a strong appreciation for the agile working methods and the iterative approach to solution building that I saw engineering teams apply over and over. I began exploring web development on my own and quickly realised it was the next step for my career.
