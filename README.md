Welcome to my github profile! My name is Alphonso (exactly like the mango :mango:) and I am currently reskilling as a Frontend Web Developer.

## Currently, I'm...
:microscope: going through the Founders and Coders skills bootcamp for HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This profile holds a lot of study projects related to the skills bootcamp.

## Background
My previous experience includes 4 years as a HR professional and a few years prior to that as an operational manager across different kinds of businesses. These roles had a strong focus on the soft skills needed for cooperation and also a lot of real-world problem solving and a creative approach to building scalable working systems.

As a HR professional I also did a lot of work focused on setting up and improving Information Systems, which triggered my curiosity over a change of career.
